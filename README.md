# Instructions

Fork and clone this repo.

This is going to be a project from scratch, as such there are not any real instructions. The wire frames above are a guideline, but here are the features that must be part of the project.

**Main Page**

* Links are displayed in a list on the main page
* Links can be upvoted or downvoted
* Links are ordered according to their votes, more popular links are at the top
* A button links to a submission page where users can add links

**Add Link Page**

* Form to add a url, and a title
* When submitted, it will add the link to the database
* After submission, the user will be taken back to the main page
* If the user does not want to add a link, they can navigate back to the main page

## Tips

This is a full stack project, however unlike Galvanize Eats there is not user stories. We suggest that you begin there.

* Create User stories
* Create wireframes
* Create the ERD
* Double check your work with a cohort-mate or instructor as a sanity check
* Concentrate on one user story at a time, deploying after each one
* Take breaks often
* Ask for help after being stuck for 30 - 60 minutes
